In the event of a puncture, [self-sealing fuel tanks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sealing_fuel_tank) swell, absorb fuel, and expand so as to minimize fuel loss and resulting damage. They are common in military aircraft since they significantly improve the survival rate of aircraft that take fire. I was surprised to learn that they were in use as early as the 1920s and were used extensively by aircraft throughout World War II.
