[Gary Brooks Faulkner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Brooks_Faulkner) was a middle-aged landlord who made seven trips to Pakistan in a one-man attempt to hunt for Osama bin Laden. "His sixth attempt involved flying to Pakistan through hang gliding, though he had never used a hang glider before."
