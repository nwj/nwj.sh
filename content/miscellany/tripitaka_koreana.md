The [Tripitaka Koreana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripitaka_Koreana) is a collection of Buddhist scriptures carved onto 81,258 wooden printing blocks. It is the oldest extant version of the Buddhist canon in the Hanja script. "The woodblocks are in pristine condition without warping or deformation despite being created more than 750 years ago."
