The record duration for refueled, crewed flight is held by Robert Timm and John Cook, both civilians, and _Hacienda_, their Cessna 172. [In 1958, they kept this plane in-flight continuously for 64 days.](https://www.aopa.org/news-and-media/all-news/2008/march/pilot/endurance-test-circa-1958) Their refueling strategy involved flying at low speed and altitude along a section of straight road near Blythe, California and using a winch to raise a fuel hose from a modified Ford truck driving below.
