In modern usage, the word "nostalgia" generally means "yearning for the past". But when it was coined, the meaning was narrower and specifically referred to homesickness. Thus the Greek roots νόστος (nóstos, "homecoming") and ἄλγος (álgos, "pain, ache"). At the time, this was meant quite literally as [a medical condition that specifically afflicted the Swiss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostalgia#As_a_medical_condition), with symptoms including fever, stomach pain, and death.
