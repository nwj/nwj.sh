The [Carrington Event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_storm_of_1859) was a huge solar storm in 1859. During the event, auroras were visible as far south as the Caribbean and telegraph systems all over the world failed. Some telegraph operators reported that they could continue to send and receive messages even though their systems were disconnected from any source of electricity.
