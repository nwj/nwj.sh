Human intestines have glands that produce a substance called "intestinal juice". The modern, uninspired name for these glands is the "intestinal glands". But back in the past, when one could still unironically refer to oneself as a "natural philosopher", these glands were called the ["Crypts of Lieberkühn"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestinal_gland).
