[Saccadic masking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccadic_masking) is the phenomenon where human brains block visual processing while the eyes are moving so that we don't perceive motion blur from those eye movements. The brain creates the illusion of continuity during these brief moments of blindness by inferring the missing visual information and [committing those inferences to memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transsaccadic_memory).
