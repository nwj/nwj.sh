[Agloe, New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agloe,_New_York) was a fictional town included on some Esso maps as a way of catching plagiarist mapmakers. Ironically, a store later opened at the location and, taking its name from the map, called itself the Agloe General Store, thereby transforming the fictional location into a real location.
