Nuclear submarines primarily produce oxygen via electrolysis. However, as a backup, they require a system for oxygen generation that works even in the event of power failure. That backup system is [oxygen candles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_oxygen_generator#Oxygen_candle), which release oxygen when they are burnt.
