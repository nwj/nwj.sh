[Śmigus-dyngus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9Amigus-dyngus) is a Polish celebration in which men dress up in elaborate and colorful handmade costumes and throw water on any woman they encounter. "The origins of the word _dyngus_ are obscure as it may come from the German _Dingeier_ ("owed eggs", the Easter eggs that are to be given to children) or _Dingnis, Dingnus_ (ransom paid during the war to protect against pillaging)."
