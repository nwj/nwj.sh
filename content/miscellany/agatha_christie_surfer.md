Agatha Christie was a surfer. She learned to surf prone in South Africa at [Muizenberg Beach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muizenberg#Beach_front) and then later learned to surf standing up in Waikiki. "Oh it was heaven! Nothing like rushing through the water at what seems to you a speed of about two hundred miles an hour. It is one of the most perfect physical pleasures I have known."
