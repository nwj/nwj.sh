The [Fool's Gold Loaf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fool%27s_Gold_Loaf) is an 8,000 calorie sandwich made by hollowing out a loaf of bread and filling it with peanut butter, jelly, and bacon. Elvis was a huge fan and apparently once took his private jet from Memphis to Denver solely to pick up 22 of these sandwiches, which he then ate in the airport hangar with his 2 guests and 2 pilots.
