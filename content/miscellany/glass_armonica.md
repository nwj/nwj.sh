The glass armonica is a mechanical musical instrument, invented by Benjamin Franklin, that uses a series of glass bowls rotated around a spindle to produce musical tones. Bizarrely, the instrument was [rumored to cause both musicians and listeners to go mad. ["[The harmonica] excessively stimulates the nerves, plunges the player into a nagging depression and hence into a dark and melancholy mood, that is an apt method for slow self-annihilation."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_harmonica#Purported_dangers)
