The [catoblepas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catoblepas) is a legendary creature, probably inspired by real-life encounters with wildebeest, that was said to have had a killing gaze similar to a gorgon or basilisk. Prior to learning about this, I had wondered why the [Gorgons in Heroes of Might and Magic III](https://heroes.thelazy.net/index.php/Gorgon_and_Mighty_Gorgon) looked like bulls, rather than the more typical medusa.
