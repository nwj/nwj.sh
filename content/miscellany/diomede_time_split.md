The [Diomede Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diomede_Islands) are two remote islands, located roughly in the middle of the Bering Strait. The international date line runs directly between them, so despite being only 3.8 kilometers from each other, they observe a 20 or 21 hour time difference from each other.
