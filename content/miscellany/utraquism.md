[Utraquism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utraquism) is a Christian belief that during communion, both bread and wine (and not just bread alone) should be administered to laypeople ("communion under both kinds"). The Hussites fought several wars from 1419-34, partly over this dogma. Catholic practice didn't change to permit communion under both kinds until 1965 with Vatican II.
