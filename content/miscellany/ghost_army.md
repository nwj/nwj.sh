The [Ghost Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_Army) was a tactical deception unit of the U.S. Army during WWII that utilized inflatable tanks, sound trucks, fake radio transmissions, and other deceptions in order to create the appearance that troops were deployed in locations where they were not.
