The U.S. House of Representatives has a large ceremonial mace, made of ebony and silver, known as [the Mace of the Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mace_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives). "On the rare occasion that a member becomes unruly, the Sergeant at Arms, upon order of the Speaker, lifts the mace from its pedestal and presents it before the offenders, thereby restoring order."
