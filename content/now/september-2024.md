I left [Braze](https://www.braze.com) in March, after ten years working there. So for the past six months, I have been on a sabbatical.{% sidenote() %}While a sabbatical sometimes refers to a period of leave, sponsored by your employer, after which you return to your job - that is not what I am doing. I resigned from my prior job, and will look for a new one when this ends.{% end %}

After a decade working full-time, this has been a welcome change of pace and an opportunity for some exploration. I've read a bunch of good books, baked lots of sourdough, and scratched various coding itches. On the coding side of things, it's been great to try out some technologies that I hadn't previously built with, like [htmx](https://htmx.org/) and [axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum). I've been running, lifting weights, and rock climbing more regularly, which has been excellent for my health. I've traveled a bit - to Singapore and Australia on my honeymoon - and to Rockland, Maine and Bloomington, Indiana to see some friends and family. And while I am still very far from being a capable Spanish speaker, I now know about 1,500 commonly-used words and some basic grammar.

Finally, at the end of August, I made the decision to look for another job when this sabbatical ends, rather than trying to found a company. So, I've started to take some preparatory steps for the eventual job hunt, like redesigning this website and daily coding interview practice.
