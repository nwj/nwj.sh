My sabbatical continues into its (likely) final few months.

On the coding front, much of my time and attention has been going towards coding interview practice, but I am also in the middle of a redesign and rewrite of my command-line note-taking tool, [`zeke`](https://github.com/nwj/zeke). I'd like to put that into a 1.0 release before the sabbatical ends.

In October, I also started 3x/week Spanish lessons with a tutor, via [Preply](https://preply.com/en/?pref=MTYzNDUwOTI=&id=1731362948.927628). Unsurprisingly, this has pretty substantially accelerated the rate at which I'm learning the language, and I regret not starting earlier.{% margin_note() %}Bloom's 2 sigma problem rides again...{% end %} Even with all these great language learning resources on the internet, there's still no substitute for one-on-one instruction by a teacher who is a native speaker.

Currently reading Bryan Ward-Perkin's [_The Fall of Rome: And the End of Civilization_](https://www.amazon.com/Fall-Rome-End-Civilization-ebook/dp/B006OYD2K6), which is not going to make it into [the Library](/library). The book has the great advantage of a clear argument that cuts against the recent historiography. And I'm sympathetic to its thesis that the Western Roman Empire really did go through a calamitous "fall". But the book could have presented its evidence so much more comprehensively than it does. The whole thing feels like it was written prior to the advent of computation and data analysis.

Also listening to lots of [Bobby Zimmerman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R53v2kxqkV4) and [some blues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPai0e5qrSo) as a post-election salve.
