### Biology

Human intestines have glands that produce a substance called "intestinal juice". The modern, uninspired name for these glands is the "intestinal glands". But back in the past, when one could still unironically refer to oneself as a "natural philosopher", these glands were called the ["Crypts of Lieberkühn"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestinal_gland).

Hippopotami secrete a red pigment, colloquially known as "blood sweat", officially called [hipposudoric acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipposudoric_acid), which acts as a natural sunscreen and antimicrobial agent.

### Culture

Thelonious Monk's middle name is ["Sphere"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelonious_Monk). The name comes from his maternal grandfather who had the (awesome) name: Sphere Batts.

In 1997, David Bowie sold the right to ten years worth of royalties from his work for $55m in the form of [Bowie Bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrity_bond#Bowie_Bonds).

### History

The research leading to the successful development of oral contraceptives was almost entirely funded by donations from a single person - [Katherine McCormick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katharine_McCormick#Philanthropist), heiress to a substantial portion of the McCormick combine harvester fortune.

The [demon core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_core) was a sphere of plutonium, originally developed by the Manhattan Project as a fissile core for an atomic bomb, but subsequently repurposed as a test device. It was involved in two fatal accidents where physicists working with the core were killed by radiation bursts.

During World War II, the U.S. developed an experimental test fighter aircraft known as the ["Flying Pancake"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vought_V-173).

The Romans apparently used [war pigs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_pig) as a counter-measure against war elephants. More colorful accounts of this practice include the stratagem of dousing the pigs in pitch, lighting them on fire, and driving them towards the elephants.

### Language

In modern usage, the word "nostalgia" generally means "yearning for the past". But when it was coined, the meaning was narrower and specifically referred to homesickness. Thus the Greek roots νόστος (nóstos, "homecoming") and ἄλγος (álgos, "pain, ache"). At the time, this was meant quite literally as [a medical condition that specifically afflicted the Swiss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostalgia#As_a_medical_condition), with symptoms including fever, stomach pain, and death.

There are a surprisingly large number of [whistled languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistled_language#List_of_whistled_languages).

### Places

[Marble Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marble_Hill,_Manhattan#Separation_from_Manhattan_Island) is a neighborhood in New York City that is legally part of the borough of Manhattan, but is not located on the island of Manhattan. Originally at the northern tip of the island, the neighborhood was separated from Manhattan in 1895 by the construction of the Harlem Ship Canal. In 1914, the part of the Harlem River that ran along the north of Marble Hill was filled in, so the neighborhood is now directly connected to the Bronx.

### Technology

Passing two arguments to `cd` will cause it to navigate in such a way that it searches `pwd` for the first argument and swaps it for the second. For example, invoking `cd jane jill` from `/home/jane` navigates to `/home/jill`.

Nuclear submarines primarily produce oxygen via electrolysis. However, as a backup, they require a system for oxygen generation that works even in the event of power failure. That backup system is [oxygen candles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_oxygen_generator#Oxygen_candle), which release oxygen when they are burnt.

In the event of a puncture, [self-sealing fuel tanks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sealing_fuel_tank) swell, absorb fuel, and expand so as to minimize fuel loss and resulting damage. They are common in military aircraft since they significantly improve the survival rate of aircraft that take fire. I was surprised to learn that they were in use as early as the 1920s and were used extensively by aircraft throughout World War II.

### Biology

[Saccadic masking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccadic_masking) is the phenomenon where human brains block visual processing while the eyes are moving so that we don't perceive motion blur from those eye movements. The brain creates the illusion of continuity during these brief moments of blindness by inferring the missing visual information and [committing those inferences to memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transsaccadic_memory).

### History

The [Carrington Event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_storm_of_1859) was a huge solar storm in 1859. During the event, auroras were visible as far south as the Caribbean and telegraph systems all over the world failed. Some telegraph operators reported that they could continue to send and receive messages even though their systems were disconnected from any source of electricity.

Between 1977 and 2014, the government of the Philippines waged an on-again-off-again campaign against a violent Islamic nationalist group known as the [Moro Islamic Liberation Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moro_Islamic_Liberation_Front) or MILF for short.

The [Younger Dryas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Younger_Dryas) were a climatic event, roughly 12,500 years ago, during which temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere temporarily reverted to glacial conditions.

Mauritania [did not criminalize slave ownership until 2007](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_Mauritania#Modern_slavery) and has done little to actually enforce its anti-slavery laws since then. A [2018 estimate](https://www.globalslaveryindex.org/2018/data/country-data/mauritania/) suggested that 21 of every 1000 people in Mauritania were still enslaved at that time.

A [punkahwallah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punkah_wallah) was a servant who worked a manual cooling fan, often operated through a pulley system. Apparently the deaf were favored for this obsolete occupation, as they could not overhear confidential conversations happening around them.

The [Astor Place Riot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astor_Place_Riot) occurred in 1849 in New York City. The riot was started over a dispute about which of two famous Shakespearean actors was better than the other. Another ridiculous New York City riot was the [1922 Straw Hat Riot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_Hat_Riot). It was sparked when a tradition of "hat bashing" (knocking straw hats off of wearers' heads and stomping on them if the hats were worn after September 15th) spiraled out of control. In yet another strange example of nominative determinism, many of the arrested rioters were sentenced by the Magistrate Peter A. Hatting.

The [Ghost Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_Army) was a tactical deception unit of the U.S. Army during WWII that utilized inflatable tanks, sound trucks, fake radio transmissions, and other deceptions in order to create the appearance that troops were deployed in locations where they were not.

### Mathematics

[Little's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little%27s_law), which states that, for a queue, the average number of items in queue (L) is equal to the average rate at which new items arrive (λ) times the average time an item spends in queue (W). So, L = λ * W. Useful for estimating one feature of a queue based on the other two features.

[Chirality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirality) is the property of lacking a mirror image that can be created via rotation or translation. The classic example of a chiral object is the human hand.

### Places

The [Eye of the Sahara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richat_Structure) is an eroded igneous rock dome that looks like a giant eye when viewed from above. The effect is like something out of science fiction.

The [Diomede Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diomede_Islands) are two remote islands, located roughly in the middle of the Bering Strait. The international date line runs directly between them, so despite being only 3.8 kilometers from each other, they observe a 20 or 21 hour time difference from each other.

[Magnitogorsk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitogorsk), literally "the City of the Magnetic Mountain", is an industrial city that served as the Soviet Union's primary steel production facility during World War Two. Also, the city's flag is [badass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitogorsk#/media/File:Flag_of_Magnitogorsk_(Chelyabinsk_oblast).svg).

[Shibam Hadramawt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibam_Hadramawt) is a town in Yemen known for its mudbrick high-rise buildings. These houses, which range from 5 to 11 storeys, are among the tallest mudbrick structures in the world, and are unusually old examples of vertical construction.

### Technology

In Vim, invoking the `gf` command while the cursor is over a file path will open that file in a new buffer.

In Rust, there is the `unreachable!()` macro. Fine. But there is also the (vastly superior) [`xkcd_unreachable!()`](https://docs.rs/crate/xkcd_unreachable/).

### Miscellaneous

The (campy, terrible) Bond film _Live and Let Die_ includes a scene where Bond uses the backs of three crocodiles as stepping stones to skip across a water channel. Turns out this stunt [actually used live crocodiles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDeUzB12ln8). Insane.

A [fleuron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleuron_(typography)) is a typographic ornament, typically a stylized version of a leaf or flower. A sort of archaic precursor to dingbats.

The [catoblepas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catoblepas) is a legendary creature, probably inspired by real-life encounters with wildebeest, that was said to have had a killing gaze similar to a gorgon or basilisk. Prior to learning about this, I had wondered why the [Gorgons in Heroes of Might and Magic III](https://heroes.thelazy.net/index.php/Gorgon_and_Mighty_Gorgon) looked like bulls, rather than the more typical medusa.

The [chiroplast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiroplast) was a sort of wooden hand brace used to train "proper" hand positioning for piano players.
