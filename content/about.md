Hi! I'm Nick, but many people refer to me as NWJ (my initials), both online and in meatspace.

I've worked as a software engineer and engineering manager for over ten years, mostly at [Braze](https://www.braze.com). I was an early engineering hire there,{% sidenote() %}Depending how you count, I was roughly Braze's seventh or eighth engineer.{% end %} and eventually ended up managing a group of about fifty engineers across five teams. Professionally, I've mostly focused on web development and distributed systems work, but I've also dabbled in a few other technical domains on the side.

Looking further back, my path into software engineering was somewhat circuitous and meandering. In college, at [Swarthmore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarthmore_College), I studied history and philosophy. And my first job post-graduation was as a policy analyst, working for former New York State Budget Director, [Paul Francis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Francis).

Outside of work, I read,{% sidenote() %}See the [Library](/library) for some favorites.{% end %} play games, run and lift, cook, and bake bread.
I am originally from the suburbs of NYC, and now live in Manhattan with my wife, [Janie](https://www.mofo.com/people/janie-buckley).
